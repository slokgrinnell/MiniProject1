First Java Miniproject: Classical Encryption
Using Caeser and Vigen√®re Cipher

Prof SamR helped me to set up the testing file.

Github repo: https://github.com/slokgrinnell/MiniProject1

Acknowledgements: Mentor Session Avaash. He helped me see why I had a error while doing the mvn test.
He gave me a hint that it might be that the program is not recognizing if the user types decode as the first element.
So also used this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22150650/looping-through-all-main-arguments
to know how to loop through the arguments

Also used Stringbuilder because I saw a youtube video and Avaash also said that it might be good to use that.
